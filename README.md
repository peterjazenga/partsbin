# partsbin
A database (mysql) to manage parts stock with extensions specific to the electronics industry with controlling applications written in Pascal
As an electronics engineer I have need to control my stock of parts with ability to search by parameters such as voltage, frequency, capacitance, inductance, resistance and so on<br>
Standard stock control programs do not include this feature so I am building it into my own partsbin database
